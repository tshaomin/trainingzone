	Here is <b>one</b> of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training: <br>
</div>

<div class="container6">
	Anyone got a <h9><u>lecture clash</u></h9> ? &nbsp; They're not <b>pretty</b>, but with your help, they can be <b>manageable</b>. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: <br>
<br>
•	Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. <br>
<br>
•	Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough).<br>
<br>
•	Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. <br>
<br>
•	Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:  <h5>
o	If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. <br>
o	Which one are you most on top of? <br>
	o	Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</h5>
•	Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.<br>
